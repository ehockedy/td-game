Client renderer optimisations:
 (based on quick observations and profiling)
 - Profiling suggests that client is rendering 3 times as fast as server is sending, so can reduce the render rate.
Render moving tower on client
Bullet and enemy collision animation
Add middle of subgrid size to config
Make sure that a bullet that is within the hitbox of an enemy, is not actually in an adjacent box
 - or, make sure to check all 3*3 grid of bullets around each enemy
Sort out even cols infinite loop issue
 -  odd sided grids get stuck in infinite loop - I assume becuase can never meet the end condition since steps are take as multiples of 2 so that no bit of path is adjacent!
Bullet movement tests
Fix the fact that Point has hard coded sub grid size set - in tests have seen that using a different subgrid size to the default, they still pass
 - enemy tests are find because poit is not used - just goes through pre generated path
 - but in bullet tests Point is used, and still passes - meaning that as far as the bullet is concerned it shoudl not be in a different square
Use interactiveChildren property for containers
Towers can go on same grid on client - stop this
Make the towers always be moving, might make them a bit more realistic
Remove the events from a client view on stopRendering
Put place tower buttons by the tower, not on toolbar
Component that is the town being attacked or whatever. If enemy reached it, can tell because of change in lives value so play animation
If player does nothing for 2ish minutes, they are disconnected and cannot reconnect, would have to join game again. If they interact with the map will cause server error because they are at the 
game screen, with a new, different game code.
Remove money view for other players, just put players money and put it near the towers so they can easily compare prices
Tower range is above towers placed before that tower, but under others - make it a ring not circle?
Other towers:
 - support ones like mopeny/points booster if enemy killed in its range?

Main features:
 - buy/sell towers
 - placement round behaviour - all take a turn or simultaneous - what about if  players place at same time?
 - game over screen
 - info buttons
 - game settings menu - have game code in here
 - save game behaviour
 - player leaves game behaviour
