Client renderer optimisations:
 (based on quick observations and profiling)
 - Profiling suggests that client is rendering 3 times as fast as server is sending, so can reduce the render rate.
Render moving tower on client
Bullet and enemy collision animation
Add middle of subgrid size to config
Fastest/slowest could be good aim behaviours for towers
Make sure that a bullet that is within the hitbox of an anamy, is not actually in an adjacent box
 - or, make sure to check all 3*3 grid of bullets around each enemy
Sort out even cols infinite loop issue
 -  odd sided grids get stuck in infinite loop - I assume becuase can never meet the end condition since steps are take as multiples of 2 so that no bit of path is adjacent!
Bullet movement tests
Fix the fact that Point has hard coded sub grid size set - in tests have seen that using a different subgrid size to the default, they still pass
 - enemy tests are find because poit is not used - just goes through pre generated path
 - but in bullet tests Point is used, and still passes - meaning that as far as the bullet is concerned it shoudl not be in a different square
Use interactiveChildren property for containers
Towers can go on same grid on client
Make the towers always be moving, might make them a bit more realistic
