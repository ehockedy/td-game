Client renderer optimisations:
 (based on quick observations and profiling)
 - Profiling suggests that client is rendering 3 times as fast as server is sending, so can reduce the render rate.
Render moving tower on client
Bullet and enemy collision animation
Add middle of subgrid size to config
Make sure that a bullet that is within the hitbox of an enemy, is not actually in an adjacent box
 - or, make sure to check all 3*3 grid of bullets around each enemy
Sort out even cols infinite loop issue
 -  odd sided grids get stuck in infinite loop - I assume becuase can never meet the end condition since steps are take as multiples of 2 so that no bit of path is adjacent!
Bullet movement tests
Fix the fact that Point has hard coded sub grid size set - in tests have seen that using a different subgrid size to the default, they still pass
 - enemy tests are find because poit is not used - just goes through pre generated path
 - but in bullet tests Point is used, and still passes - meaning that as far as the bullet is concerned it shoudl not be in a different square
Use interactiveChildren property for containers
Towers can go on same grid on client - stop this
Make the towers always be moving, might make them a bit more realistic
Remove the events from a client view on stopRendering
Put place tower buttons by the tower, not on toolbar
Component that is the town being attacked or whatever. If enemy reached it, can tell because of change in lives value so play animation
With the tower menu icons, I think a better solution to current is this:
 - have a non-interactive sprite (i.e. just the "icon"), and laid on top of that the interactive, draggable sprite.
 - Can use this draggable sprite like normal, but instead of removing it when releasing, just ping it back to he icon position.
 - so never need to create more or remove any, can only have one at a time, and should work with mobile

Main features:
 - stop tower placement during round
 - group lives
 - buy/sell towers
 - placement round behaviour - all take a turn or simultaneous - what about if  players place at same time?
 - game over screen
 - info buttons
 - game settings menu - have game code in here
 - save game behaviour
 - player leaves game behaviour
